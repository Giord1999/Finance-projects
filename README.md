# Finance-projects
In this repository are stored all the projects that I made during my master's degree in finance and quantitative methods for economics. 
In particular, the focus of the files contained in this repository is the pricing of options using different models (mainly Black and Scholes, but also Heston and
Monte Carlo) applied in Python. The options i try to price are mainly vanilla, because it's easier to make comparisons between the Black and Scholes price and the Monte Carlo one.

In this repository you can also find some files regarding risk management. In particular you can find two files in which I address the topic of volatility, calculating both the historical
and the implied volatility. Additionally, there's also a simulation of the Value at Risk of a stock portfolio.

Additionally in this repository you will find two files in which I try to develop some adjustment to a loan-analyst application made by another programmer. 

In conclusion, there are also two files in which I address some problems regarding technical analysis of stocks.
